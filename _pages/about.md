Currently, Iâ€™m an undergraduate student of CE at Shahid Beheshti University. My research interests include Deep Learning in particular and Machine
Learning in general, with applications in Graph Learning, and Computer Vision. I intend to better understand these methods in a principled
manner by investigating their underlying mathematics and their practical implications in real life. My research goal is to channel such better
theoretical and functional understanding of these new methods toward better practical solutions for real-life problems.

## Research Interests

- Machine Learning
- Graph Neural Networks
- Computer Vision
- AI in Healthcare

## Education

- B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, (2018 - 2023)
